# HI, I'm shadoww

Hello everyone, My name is Shadoww; my real name is Suraj. This is my GitHub profile.

## About Me

I am currently studying in my 3rd year of B.E (Computer Science and Engineering) and building computer programmes. I love three things: computers, food, and travelling.

## What project did I build?

I have pinned some of my top projects below, but all of those projects are rather small, and I am in the process of thinking of creating some big projects, also I would also love to collaborate on projects.

To see my projects with some styling, visit [dev-shadoww](https://dev-shadoww.github.io).

## Which software do I use?

I use `Linux`, to be precise, `Arch Linux`. I don't actually hate Windows, just that my laptop can't handle it efficiently. I am also used to Linux.

I am interested in mainly two domains: web development and AI/ML, I have learned basic web technologies and am currently learning `React.js." For AI/ML, I just started it. I want to learn AI/ML from the ground up, so I am currently polishing my math skills.

Apart from this, I know C, Python, JavaScript, and SQL. I use mainly open-source software like `inkscape` for vector graphics, `gimp` for photo editing, `shotcut` for video editing, and so on.
